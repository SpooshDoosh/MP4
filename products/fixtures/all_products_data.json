Literally translated from the Japanese Mainichi-Koh means 'Incense for everyday use', and that is exactly what it is and what Mainichi-Koh has been in Japan for more than 80 years, where it has enjoyed a wideranging popularity that has appealed to people of all ages recalling unforgettable memories.\r\n\r\nMainichi-koh sandalwood incense is pure and made without a wooden stick centre, so it burns pleasantly and without creating too much smoke. The sandalwood incense aroma is best described as being sweet, fresh and woody.\r\n\r\nThe scent of sandalwood can be calming and help you unwind, so it could be a good choice of incense to use if you’re keen to relax more or want to create a calming atmosphere in your home.  You may also find that the scent lingers on in a room for a while even after the incense has stopped burning.\r\n\r\nIn an age when spiritual longings should transcend material aspirations, it is important to nourish those yearnings that emanate in the heart and motivate one to seek that love, friendship, graciousness and happiness that date back to their earliest remembrances. We, at Nippon Kodo, believe that Mainichi-Koh, which was fashioned from a traditional sandalwood formula that was popular in Japan thousands of years ago, realizes these long-sought goals and evokes an aura of graceful elegance and a feeling of deep contentment.",

But not everyone feels brave enough to follow their dreams through.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of us get caught up in the existence of day to day and lose sight of what our true purpose is.\r\n\r\nSheila Vijeyarasa lost herself in the middle of all the small decisions in her life, aching to make profound changes but not knowing what to do. Despite a great job and a life that looked exciting to others she knew deep down there was a greater, more meaningful purpose to her life.\r\n\r\nThrough struggle and heartbreak, and learning to cast aside the expectations of others and herself, Sheila found she was able to bravely step onto her Courageous Path. Taking this leap reconciled the conflict that lay within - her corporate identity and her spiritual calling - healing her body and soul.\r\n\r\nBrave: courageously live your truth is a call to all women yearning to live an authentic life and to be true to themselves and to others.\r\n\r\nNumber of Pages: 214 (Paperback)",

It can be held in the hand whilst you visualize roots sprouting forth from your feet, securing and grounding you to the earth. When travelling a path of spiritual self-improvement sometimes we can become too focussed on the heavens above and we can become disenchanted with our earthly existence. Red jasper is an earthly stone and helps combat this by reminding us that we are not here by ourselves on the physical plane.

            "description": "Sodalite is so named due to its sodium content. Its appearance has some similarities to lapis lazuli but anyone familiar with both can usually distinguish between them. \r\n\r\nThe gentle spiritual energy of sodalite promotes the need to become more complete and unify the sub-conscious, conscious and higher consciousness. When we feel more complete in this way we are able to trust more the subtle things we feel - things that can easily be dismissed as 'just a feeling'. With this new connection fears about spiritual matters can resolve themselves.",
